<<bb876>>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa has very elaborately
described the constitution of the soul in the previous chapter, with a
view to delivering His intimate friend Arjuna from the ocean of material
grief. And the path of realization has been recommended: /buddhi-yoga,/
or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Sometimes Kṛṣṇa consciousness is misunderstood
to be inertia, and one with such a misunderstanding often withdraws to a
secluded place to become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious by chanting the holy name
of Lord Kṛṣṇa. But without being trained in the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa
consciousness, it is not advisable to chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa in a
secluded place, where one may acquire only cheap adoration from the
innocent public. Arjuna also thought of Kṛṣṇa consciousness or
/buddhi-yoga,/ or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge, as
something like retirement from active life and the practice of penance
and austerity at a secluded place. In other words, he wanted to
skillfully avoid the fighting by using Kṛṣṇa consciousness as an excuse.
But as a sincere student, he placed the matter before his master and
questioned Kṛṣṇa as to his best course of action. In answer, Lord Kṛṣṇa
elaborately explained /karma-yoga,/ or work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in
this Third Chapter.
